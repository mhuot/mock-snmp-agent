## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Simulator won't start:**
- Check if another process is using the port
- Verify Python and package versions
- Check firewall settings

**No SNMP responses:**
- Confirm simulator is running: `ps aux | grep snmpsim`
- Test with correct port (default: 11611)
- Verify community string and OID

**Docker issues:**
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check port mappings (`-p 11611:161/udp`)
- Verify image build completed successfully

### Self-Service Diagnostics

Run these commands to help diagnose issues:

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python test_prd_requirements.py

# Check performance
python performance_test.py

# Verify installation
pip show snmpsim-lextudio

# Test SNMP tools
snmpget -v2c -c public localhost:11611 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
