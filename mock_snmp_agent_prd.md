# Mock SNMP Agent for Simulation

## Overview
The Mock SNMP Agent is a tool designed to simulate the behavior of a real SNMP agent for testing and training purposes. It will allow developers to test their SNMP management tools against various scenarios and edge cases in a controlled environment.

## Objectives
1. Simulate a variety of SNMP agent behaviors for testing and training
2. Provide a controllable and deterministic environment for SNMP tool development
3. Support easy integration with existing SNMP tools and frameworks

## Functional Requirements
1. SNMP Support
   - Implement SNMP v1, v2c, and v3 protocol support
   - Respond to SNMP GET, GETNEXT, GETBULK, and SET requests
   - Allow defining custom MIB (Management Information Base) for the agent

2. Simulation Behaviors 
   - Normal operation: Respond to requests as a typical SNMP agent
   - Slow responses: Add configurable delays before sending responses  
   - Intermittent responses: Randomly drop a configurable percentage of requests
   - Packet loss: Randomly drop a configurable percentage of response packets
   - Agent restart: Simulate agent restarts at configurable intervals
   - MIB changes: Simulate dynamic MIB changes at runtime

3. Configuration
   - Allow setting simulation behaviors via configuration file and/or API
   - Support loading custom MIB definitions from files
   - Allow overriding specific MIB values via configuration

4. Logging and Metrics  
   - Log all received requests and sent responses
   - Provide metrics on request/response counts, latencies, error rates, etc.
   - Allow exporting logs and metrics for offline analysis

## Non-functional Requirements
1. Performance
   - Handle up to 1000 requests per second
   - Average response latency under 10ms (in normal operation mode) 

2. Reliability 
   - Maintain stable operation under high load and error scenarios
   - Graceful handling of invalid requests or configurations

3. Usability
   - Provide clear documentation and examples for setup and usage
   - Include a set of predefined MIBs and simulation configurations 

4. Portability
   - Support running on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms 
   - Provide packages for easy installation via pip, apt, brew, etc.

## Milestones
1. Initial prototype with basic SNMP support and static MIB (4 weeks) 
2. Simulation behaviors and dynamic configuration (6 weeks)
3. Logging, metrics, and performance optimizations (4 weeks)
4. Documentation, packaging, and release (2 weeks)

## Out of Scope  
- SNMP trap generation (focusing on agent behavior for now)
- Graphical user interface (will provide config files and APIs) 
- Simulating agent-specific MIB extensions (staying generic)
